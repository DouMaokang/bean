Defined inside [Hello.g4](Hello.g4), is a simple grammar named `Hello`:
```antlrv4
grammar Hello;
r   :   'hello' ID;
ID  :   [a-z]+;
WS  :   [ \t\r\n]+ -> skip;
```

To easily test the recognizer generated by antlr, we can use `TestRig` included in the runtime library (`org.antlr.v4.runtime.misc.TestRig`).
```shell
# alias grun=org.antlr.v4.runtime.misc.TestRig

>>> grun Hello r -tokens  # to output tokens recognized
>>> grun Hello r -gui     # to visualzed the recognized tokens
>>> grun  # to display help messages
```
